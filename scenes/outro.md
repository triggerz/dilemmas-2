# Description
Time for a little afterthought:

Consider what you might do differently if you experience similar situations in real life?

You can also review your scores. Average scores are 100 â€“ so above is good, and below is less good.

How did you do on the 3 individual scores? How did you do on the total?

Thanks for participating!
