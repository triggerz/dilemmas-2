# Description
Jens is a very experienced technician on your team. He works with the maintenance of production equipment and  has been on your team for many years. 

He tells you that one of the pumps occasionally crashes, which is very costly, as it puts a temporary hold to the production. The pump typically crashes when it's been operating for too long because the impeller blades break. Jens suggests more  frequent replacement of the blades to avoid downtime.

You know that Jens has a very busy schedule, and you are concerned that assigning him more work to replace the blades could lead to delays in his scheduled maintenance work, which would also be costly. 

How do you respond?

# Choice
I thank Jens for his suggestion and initiative to reduce system breakdowns. I ask him to update the maintenance plan for the pump and increase the frequency of impeller blade replacements so we can implement his suggestion as fast as possible.  

# Choice
I thank Jens for this suggestion. However, I evaluate  that he's currently too busy managing the daily maintenance of the production equipment to also implement the new impeller blade replacement system. His time is better spent managing daily maintenance and then fixing the occasional pump replacements when they do occur. 

# Choice
I thank Jens for his suggestion and encourage him to implement the idea. However, before implementing the new maintenance schedule, I ask him to take the needed time to plan the replacements carefully so they don't interefere with his regular maintenance work. Once we have a good plan in place, we can initiate the new schedule.
