# Description
Olga was recruited to your team from Russia three months ago. She has a highly specialised profile that is needed in your team. 

When Olga joined the team, you asked everyone on your team to make English the common language in the team.

However, you're noticing that this doesn't always happen. In fact, everyone besides Olga speaks Danish most of the time, as it turns out they don't feel comfortable expressing themselves in English. Meanwhile, Olga is beginning to come in late to work , skips social gatherings and she doesn't come for coffee breaks with the rest of the team.

What do you do?

# Choice
I understand that my Danish team members are not comfortable speaking English all the time. Therefore, I tell my team that going forward everyone will only have to communicate in English during team meetings, in shared emails and conversations that Olga participates in. When Olga is not involved, they are free to communicate in the language they prefer.

# Choice
I worry that forcing my Danish team members to speak English will have a negative infuence on the team spirit make them participate less in shared discussions. Instead, I try to set a good example myself by always speaking English, but I allow my Danish team members to decide for themselves which language they communicate in. Over time I am sure they will all feel more comfortable speaking to each other in English.

# Choice
The only way to include Olga in the team is to make all team members speak English, although myu Danish team members might not be happy with this decision in the short term. If I make English optional or dependent on Olga's presence, my Danish team members are likely to avoid Olga altogether. I contact HR to get support in making this happen in the best way possible. I am convinced that this is in the long term interest of my team's wellbeing.
