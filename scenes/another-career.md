# Description
Lone has been working in your team for the past two years. She's highly skilled and the only one who knows how to manage a core process in your team. 

Your team has been very busy this past year, so you haven't had a chance to plan how her knowledge is going to be shared with the rest of the team. 

At her mid-year year review you are surprised to learn that she wants to transition into leadership in a different part of Novo Nordisk. 

Based on your experience working with her, you don't think she'd be a good fit for a leadership role; she really struggles to delegate work and set direction. In the meeting she tells you that she's strongly considering applying for the leadership position and she would like you to be her referral. 

How do you respond?

# Choice
I don’t think Lone would thrive in a leadership role, but I acknowledge that this is something she wants to do. I tell her that she has my full support. However, I also tell her that I need her to work with me and the team over the next three months to ensure that her knowledge about the core process is transferred to the team.

# Choice
I sit down with Lone and decide to give her my sincere feedback. I exemplify why I don't think she's ready yet and suggest that we together develop a detailed 6-month development plan for her where she can get exposure to and training in the needed leadership skills. If she still wants to take on a leadership role after these six months, and has demonstrated growth, I will be happy to give her my full support and be her referral. Getting Lone to stay in my team for a few more months would also buy me time to get the rest of the team more familiar with the core process.

# Choice
Lone is a valuable team member and I would hate to see her leave. I sit down with her and ask her in more detail about her motivation to pursue a leadership role. Perhaps there are opportunities for her to stay in my team and take on more informal leadership responsibilities that we haven’t explored yet.
