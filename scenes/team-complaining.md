# Description
Daniel has been working on your team for four months, and several of your employees have flagged serious concerns over his performance. They've complained that his attention to detail is very low which has led to extra work for them because they now have to check all of his outputs. 

You used to work with Daniel in a different team years ago, and you have a great impression of his skills and personality. This makes you wonder whether your employees' complaints are truly reflective of Daniel's poor performance, or if something else is going on.

How do address your employees' complaints?

# Choice
I'm surprised to hear about the complaint. However, I also know that my own positive experience with him from the past could impact my judgment of him. I set up a meeting with HR to plan the best way forward. Before I approach Daniel, I need to explore whether there could be some undrlying reasons why my team members would complain about his performance.

# Choice
I need to get a better understanding of Daniel's overall performance. I plan to talk to Daniel, as well as a few stakeholders outside of my team who have worked with him to get their view on his skills. Once I have covered multiple views on his performance I will bettter  understand if he is performing poorly. In that case, I will let him know the areas where I expect to see an improvement in his performance moving forward.

# Choice
Even if Daniel is performing poorly we're all responsible for giving  him timely and sincere feedback to  point him in the right direction. Based on this, I have a conversation with Daniel to see how things are going and whether he is struggling somewhere. Afterwards, I meet with the team members who complained over Daniel. I use this situation as an opportunity to coach my team members to be more constructive when they identify a problem with their colleagues' performance. Perhaps they could have talked to Daniel before coming to me, or they could have offered suggestions for how to improve Daniel's attention to detail.
