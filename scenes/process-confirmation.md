# Description
You are leading a team that works in a classified not controlled (CNC) area. This means that there is a standard which specifies how to gown.

Over the past  weekyou've overheard some colleagues discuss that the standard for gowning is not being followed.

What do you?  

# Choice
I send an email to my team to remind them of the gowning standard (SOP). I also mention that if anyone has suggestions for how we can improve the standard they should let me know.

# Choice
I send an email to my team to inform them that I will Process Confirm the gowning SOP. I then go to the changing area on Monday to check whether the standard is being followed or not. When I observe anyone who doesn't follow the standard, I let them know on the spot and tell them what they need to do differently.
