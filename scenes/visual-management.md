# Description
You have recently been appointed as a new leader in a team of 10 employees. Before you joined, the team was without a leader for three months due to internal restructuring. 

The team has been responsible for the daily board meetings, but you don't think these meetings are creating as much value as they could. The board's five KPI's have been red for a long time, and there are too many complex action items that never gets done.

In response, you decide to focus on visual board management in the team.  

How do you do this?

# Choice
I want to get to know the team better before  implement any changes to the team's processes. I decide to spend my first month getting to know the team and its processes better, and if the problem persists I'll come up with an improvement plan later.

I decide to take a more active role in the daily board meetings. Going forward, I will lead the meetings and set a more clear direction for the team by demonstrating how KPI's and action items can be reached more effectively.
