# Description
Lisa, your GMP coordinator, tells you that the quality of A3s in your team varies drastically, and she thinks it might be because of lack of competencies. To improve the overall quality of A3s, Lisa suggests to make the two most skilled team members responsible for driving them, and she volunteers to lead this initiative.

How do you respond?

# Choice
I thank Lisa for making this suggestion and for taking the initiative to improve the quality of our A3s. I encourage her to apply systematic problem solving before she decides on a particular solution so that she makes sure she addresses the root cause of the low quality A3s.

# Choice
I thank Lisa for the suggestion and initiative. I tell her that I'll also take a look at the A3s. I explain that once I've had a chance to dive into this myself, we can schedule a follow-up meeting to walk through a problem diagnosis together before we commit to a particular solution.

# Choice
I thank Lisa for the suggestion. However, I tell her that I'm not entrly sure this solution addresses the root cause of the problem. I therefore propose that we schedule a follow-up meeting where we can do a systematic problem solving together and lay out our options for different solutions that address the low quality A3s.

# Choice
I thank Lisa for raising this issue but tell her that I'm concerned about narrowing down A3 competencies  to only two employees as this could limit the rest of the team's development. Instead, I let her know that I'll take an action sticker to the AM performance board with a suggestion of a team-wide A3 re-training.
