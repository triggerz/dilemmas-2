# Description
Two specialized members of your team are working on a project that has a deadline in two weeks. Vivian, your direct manager, asks you to put the project on hold because she needs the two team members to work on a new project, which has a higher priority.  

You worry about this decision, and tell her that delaying the current project could lead to serious challenges for a wide range of internal stakeholders who rely on the outputs of the project to be completed on time.  You also worry about how your two team member's will react.

Vivian insists that the the new project needs to start immediately.

What do you do?

# Choice
I am not convinced that Vivian is making the right call. After talking to her, I send her a follow-up e-mail which outlines the exact consequences of her request. I ask her to reconsider the decision, or at least postpone it by another two weeks until we are done with the current project.

# Choice
I call for an emergency meeting with the two members of my team. I let them know about Vivian's request. I acknowledge that the timing is bad but that we have to do as she says. I tell them that I will get in touch with our internal stakeholders and prepare them for the upcoming delay of our deliverables.

# Choice
 I tell Vivian that I would like to make the shift in priorities, but that I have some clarifying questions about the need to make the shift now. Perhaps there are important facts about the new project that I've missed, or perhaps Vivian doesn't fully understand the urgency of my team's current project. Once I understand why Vivian is pushing for an immediate shift, it will be easier for me to implement and explain to my two team members.

# Choice
I call for an emergency meeting with the two members of my team. I tell them about the shift in priorities and explain that their time is more valuable to the new project. I ask them how they want to communicate the delay of our current deliverables to our stakeholders, and ask them to help me come up with a plan for the shift.
